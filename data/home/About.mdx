Currently, I’m a research intern in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, advised by Prof. [Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/) and [Yigong Hu](https://yigonghu.github.io/), focus on system reliability and AI for systems. 
Previously, I was a research assistant in the Southern University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. [Fengwei Zhang](https://fengweiz.github.io/), focused on system security.

My research interests lie in building effient and reliable systems, 
through hardware\-software co\-design spanning multiple layers, from compilers and system scheduling to low-level hardware.

I’m looking for a PhD position for Fall 2025 PhD programs. Please reach out to me if your are looking for PhD students.
