I'm a first year PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) advised by [George Candea](https://dslab.epfl.ch/people/candea/). Before that, I was a research intern in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, advised by Prof. [Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/) and Prof. [Yigong Hu](https://yigonghu.github.io/). 

My research interests lie in AI systems, particularly making scalability and performance of machine learning clusters reliable and predictable.
